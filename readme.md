python macro sample for libre office.

develpment environment
-----
Libre offce 5.1  

Files
-----
+ Dialog1.xdl   
To make this sample work,you have to import this dialog to libre office.

+ test.py  
macro module.  
copy it to LibreOffice directory,in my case it is  
"D:\Program Files (x86)\LibreOffice 5\share\Scripts\python\"

+ unopy.py  
This is needed when run test.py externaly,not macro.
